# Road-to-Transformation

Old Project of mine, no dependancies required (other than python 3 obviously..) simply run the file *road to transformation V1.11.py* and enjoy. Those more interested about the musical theory involved should visit [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Riemannian_theory) link. 

You can find the full list of chords in the *road to transformation.txt* file. Additionally, you may play your generated chord progression by clicking on the play button once chord generation is complete

All audio files used in this project were recorded by myself.

## Note
This application may appear to crash at times, however, the freezes you will encounter are as a due to the program running the included audio files, which makes the gui non responsive. Simply wait for the audio to end and you should be able to use the application.
